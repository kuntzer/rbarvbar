## Orbital rendezvous plots

This small tools computes the trajectory of a chaser and of a target to generate a vbar - rbar plot.
This plot centered on the target with in the -x direction (v bar) the direction of the velocity vector of the target and in the -y direction (R bar) the direction of the center of the Earth.
The different scripts correspond to different configurations of the chaser orbit. 
Note that this tool is limited to circular orbit for the target.

See that paper for historical examples: [Rendezvous and Proximity Operations of the Space Shuttle 5](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070018243.pdf)

## TODOs

- Possibility to execute Delta v mid flight
- Possibility to change the central body
